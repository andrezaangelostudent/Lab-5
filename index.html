    <figcaption>Leaf in PNG. Reprinted from freesvg website</figcaption>  <!--Description of the image-->
    <p>This image is in PNG format. The quality of the image is good, but when the width is maximized through the scale up button, the image changes format.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<br><br> <!--add space-->

<button id="scale-button">Scale Up</button> <!--Create a button and the name of the button-->

<script> //Script to determinate that when the scale up button is pressed the width of the images inside leaf-container is changed
    document.getElementById('scale-button').addEventListener('click', function () {
        const images = document.querySelectorAll('.leaf-container img');
        images.forEach(function (img) {
            img.style.width = '500px';
        });
    });
</script>

<p><em> In conclusion, I observed changes in the characteristics of the images, particularly those that lost quality when the screen was maximized. Creating the interaction for the button and centralizing the images within the leaf container proved to be quite challenging.</em></p>
<p>Bonus: When I applied the brightness, contrast, and grayscale filters to the images, I observed that GIF and PNG images were not significantly modified. In contrast, JPEG and SVG images underwent noticeable changes, with their colors appearing lighter.</p>
